### Problem the Portfolio Project is Intended to Solve
Pense (blog app) is intended to solve the problem of providing individuals and organisations with a platform to create, publish, and manage their written content in an organised and user-friendly manner. The project aims to simplify the process of content creation, publication, and engagement, making it easier for users to reach their target audience.

**Note**
> ### What the Portfolio Project Will Not Solve
> Pense (blog app) as a portfolio project, will not solve every possible problem related to content creation or publishing. It will not address issues beyond content management, such as e-commerce, social networking, or multimedia content management, two factor authentication.

1. Bloggers and Writers
2. Businesses
3. Content Creators
4. Readers and Subscribers
5. Relevance to a Specific Locale
Pense (blog app), in general, is not inherently tied to a specific locale or location. It can be used globally, and its content can be accessible worldwide.


### RISKS
#### Technical Risks
**Security Breach:** There is a possibility that our project may be hacked or exploited by malicious actors. This could result in exposing our user data, compromising our integrity, or damaging our reputation.
**Mitigation:** We will use secure coding practices and frameworks (Flask-Security) to prevent common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF). We will also use HTTPS and SSL certificates to encrypt our communication. 
#### Non-Technical Risks
**Scope Creep:** There is a possibility that we may add more features or requirements to our project than originally planned. This could result in increasing our complexity
**Mitigation:** We will follow the agile methodology and use tools like Trello to manage our project scope. We will also communicate regularly to prioritise and validate our features. We will also avoid unnecessary changes and focus on the core functionality of our project.


## EXISTING SOLUTIONS
**Medium:** Medium is a popular online publishing platform that allows anyone to create and share stories, articles, and blogs. It has a simple and elegant user interface, a rich text editor, and a large and engaged community of readers and writers.
**Similarities:** Supports various types of content, such as text, images, videos, and audio.
**Differences:** Users can’t follow other users who write about topics that interest them.
Users can’t make money from their stories and they can’t set up a paywall for their stories, which means that all members can access their blog.
We want to focus on the core functionality of creating and sharing content. We also want to avoid the complexity and cost of implementing these features. Therefore, our project is different from Medium in these aspects
